# Database_Technology_FinalProject
The main file to run the program is logInPage.py in the pages folder. This file connects to the other 7 files that are situated in the pages folder, each of these files represent one of the table in our database.

db_Ui.py stands as the start of our project's journey. It was the code that set the base for each page, from there, they were expanded upon and created into the new program in the pages folder.

Database.sql is the files that contains all of the necessary components for our database.
